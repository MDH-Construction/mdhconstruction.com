                    Michael and his crews have been awesome to work with for our
                    home improvements. They have been amazing at keeping the
                    areas they have worked on clean when they leave for the day,{' '}
                    <strong>
                      they are fast, efficient, and we’re very happy with the
                      work done so far
                    </strong>
                    . There were some snags with getting the lumber due to
                    Covid-19, but Michael kept us informed along the way and was
                    able to get every we needed. He had a solution to keep our
                    project on track if he couldn’t, which was awesome. We even
                    threw a couple extra projects on because they have been so
                    easy to work with. Highly recommend giving Michael a call
                    for any of your house projects.
